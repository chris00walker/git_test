Hey Chris!

This is just a short message to welcome you and to applaud your efforts to learn how to code.

Remember the fundamental principle: Consistency beats intensity. It is far better to train and practice a little everyday versus alot on only one day.

This principle helps to build muscle memory. If you train regularly
muscle memory will come much faster. If you train infrequently then your
muscle memory will develop much more slowly.
