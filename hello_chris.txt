Hey Chris!

This is just a short message to welcome you and to applaud your efforts to learn how to
code. And now this also applies to Matthew.

Remember the fundamental principle: Consistency beats intensity. It is far better to train and practice a little everyday versus alot on only one day.

This principle helps to build muscle memory. If you train regularly
muscle memory will come much faster. If you train infrequently then your
muscle memory will develop much more slowly.

I started the Coursera "Learning to Learn"  and learning takes place when it is focused, deliberate practice and is supported by intervals, transfers, tests and recalls. Thank you for making this journey Chris - your brain is infinitely adaptable.
