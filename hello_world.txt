Hello,

My name is Christopher Walker and I am teaching myself to code web pages and program computers.

This is going to be a long journey - a very long journey! 

But I am up to the challenge an am excited to proceed.

I have chosen to do a Bootcamp on Udemy as well as The Odin Project.

My chosen programming language is Python

Wishing myself great success.
